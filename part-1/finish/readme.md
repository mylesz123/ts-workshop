Super simple typescript/node.js project

We are defining the data for our game counter project coming up in part 2. 
This simple starter is defining our Player object using an interface, 
creating a method to generate players dynamically, 
and just testing how how typescript catches errors at compile time before running the app.

to get started, run npm i

then npm run dev and check your terminal for the output ðŸ‘€
