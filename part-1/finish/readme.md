# Super simple typescript/node.js project

Prereqs:
1. Node.js installed on your device
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Knowledge of Javascript and es6 features


We are defining the data for our game counter project coming up in part 2. 
This simple starter is defining our Player object using an interface, 
creating a method to generate players dynamically, 
and just testing how how typescript catches errors at compile time before running the app.

To get started, run `npm i`, then `npm run dev` and check your terminal for the output ðŸ‘€.

In order for out typescript code to be compiled, we need a `tsconfig.json` file to configure how we want the typescript transpiler to work for us.

Main focus:
* review types/interfaces
* checkout autocomplete
* examine type safety when coding
* examine self documenting code
* understand ts errors
* catch errors early before we run the app
* ide special features like viewing type safety on hover in VSC
