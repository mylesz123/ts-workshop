# Welcome to the finale, part 3 
this is where we make everything "work",
we will ad players, keep score,
manage state, and more

## What are we doing?
* We will be exploring HTML form event types and we build out some functionality for our AddPlayerForm
* We will be checking out [union types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types)
* Adding functionality to our stop watch, making use of `setInterval` & `clearInterval` and how typescript can help us use those functions


## Extra Credit:
* See if you can find another area in the app that can use a union type to avoid being overly verbose with our props definitions.
* add some js doc comments to improve our documentation of our `Player` type

we will be building a form to dynamically create a player, learning how to utilize types for html input and form elements
we will be building a stop watch to manage state and side effects with react hooks 
will have methods for creating a new player, and updating score already created.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
