# Typescript-workshop ðŸ”¨

This project is a refactor of [Treehouse's React Component Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-components)

Here we will be learning about the benefits of incorporating Typescript into your React Projects. 

## Benefits include:
* Replacing the npm "prop-types" dependency with the ability to add dynamic "types" which provides more enforcement and support because we get static typing for our components. 
* Because Typescript is statically-typed, we get autocomplete in our editor with intellisense which is super useful. Static typing is a blessing because you can add types to variables, functions, and properties, making your code far easier to read, which can save us a lot of time and speed up development.
* We can share types 
* Typescript catches errors at compile time before you run the code, saving lots of time fixing bugs and greatly helps to catch mistakes early on.
* It meshes seamlessly with js, you can import js files in tsx/ts files, or vice versa. React projects built with Typescript compile to a version of JavaScript that runs on any browser.
* It provides better documentation for code and ultimately it makes it easier to define code.
* Typescript can be adopted slowly, it works the same in the browser as js.
* Itâ€™s configurable so we can make it as strict (or loose) as we like.
