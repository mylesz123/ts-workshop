# Typescript-workshop
A simple typescript workshop refactoring an existing react app

We will be working in 3 parts, 
1. building some helper methods and getting used to creating types, typing functions, and more
2. next we are bringing our code to react and building the skeleton for the game counter
3. lastly we will be implementing functionality and seeing how typescript meshes together with react

to get started, clone the repo, cd into one of the project folder subdirectories, run `npm i` and follow the start-up commands in `package.json` to run the project
